This is a guided project to support a team of researchers who have been collecting data about penguins in Antarctica!
Unfortunately, they have not been able to record the species of penguin, but they know that there are three species that are native to the region: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo, this project involves applying KMeans clustering to help them identify groups in the dataset!
